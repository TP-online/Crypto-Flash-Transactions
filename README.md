## Use of commands:  
```
/start  
  -starts the bot and displays the start message.  

/redeem <key>  
  -redeems your key for bot credits.  

/balance   
  -checks your current balance.  
  
/send <coinbase wallet ETH address>   
  -sends your flash.  
```
> **UPDATE:**  
> Since the bot has been updated, you no longer have to use the above commands. Although they still work, we now use what's called an inline-keyboard, which displays functional buttons you can select instead of typing commands. Just to improve the user experience.
  
### Most likely you will want to send smaller/more precise amounts to your prank victims. In this case, first redeem your credit and send the flash to your own Coinbase Wallet, then from there send smaller/precise amounts out to your pranking victims 😉 
###### (FYI you will need bnb also in your wallet to pay the gas fees every time you want to send)

### **Q ∙ Can I send the flash transaction to any wallet?**  
**A ∙** No. At this time ~~Coinbase Wallet~~ Base Wallet is the only one we've found to have the bug needed for this exploit. There are probably more but this is only guaranteed to work with ~~Coinbase Wallet~~ Base Wallet.  
*(If you send to a wallet that does not have the bug for example, it will show as $0.00 value)*  

### **Q ∙ How long before the transaction disappears?**  
**A ∙** Never. Unlike the original flash transaction, which never fully confirms and after a period of time, disappears from the receiving wallet. Transactions sent from our bot will be fully confirmed on the blockchain and will stay in the receiving wallet until the user attempts to send the coins to another wallet.  
*(It's important to note that the Ethereum variant being sent has high volitility and the value can increase or decrease with market trends)*  

### **Q ∙ Can I just use the bot to send straight to the person I'm pranking?**  
**A ∙** Yes and No. You absolutely can send straight from our bot to your victims, but most people will want to send a smaller/more precise amount to their vic.  
*(Each credit is good for a $1k flash, but right now for the grand opening we are adding a random bonus to each transaction. Some people have gotten as high as $4k for 1 credit.)*  

### **Q ∙ Can I send the flash to Coinbase (the exchange)?**  
**A ∙** No. Even though the exchange is also technically "Coinbase", it's ~~COINBASE WALLET~~ BASE WALLET that has the bug needed for the exploit to work. If you try to send the flash to the Coinbase Exchange, nothing will happen. The transaction will be sent to the address you provide, it will not display on Coinbase, and you just wasted a flash.  
*(Even though our bot fully confirms the transaction, the exchange doesn't contain the bug that is needed for this exploit. Only ~~Coinbase Wallet~~ Base Wallet)*
