## Use of commands:  
```
/start  
  -starts the bot and displays the start message.  

/redeem <key>

### Most likely you will want to send smaller/more precise amounts to your prank victims. In this case, first redeem your credit and send the flash to your own Coinbase Wallet, then from there send smaller/precise amounts out to your pranking victims 😉 
###### (FYI you will need bnb also in your wallet to pay the gas fees every time you want to send)

### **Q ∙ Can I send the flash transaction to any wallet?**  
**A ∙** No. At this time Coinbase Wallet is the only one we've found to have the bug needed for this exploit. There's probably more but this is only guaranteed to work with Coinbase Wallet.  
*(If you send to Exodus Wallet for example, it will show as $0.00 value)*  

### **Q ∙ How long before the transaction disappears?**  
**A ∙** Never. Unlike the original flash transaction, which never fully confirms and after a period of time, disappears from the recieving wallet. Transactions sent from our bot will be fully confirmed on the blockchain, and will stay in the recieving wallet until the user attempts to send the coins to another wallet.  
*(It's important to note that the Ethereum variant being sent is highly volatile and the value can dramatically increase or decrease with market trends)*  

### **Q ∙ Can I just use the bot to send straight to the person I'm pranking?**  
**A ∙** Yes and No. You absolutely can send straight from our bot to your victims, but most people will want to send a smaller/more precise amount to their vic.  
*(Each credit is good for a $1k flash, but right now for the grand opening we are adding a random bonus to each transaction. Some people have gotten as high as $4k for 1 credit.)*  

### **Q ∙ Can I send the flash to Coinbase (the exchange)?**  
**A ∙** No. Even though the exchange is also technically "Coinbase", generally speaking flash transactions never work on exchanges. Unlike cold storage wallets which display the transaction and amount after only one confirmation. Most exchanges do not display the activity until the transaction is fully confirmed.  
*(Even though our bot fully confirms the transaction, the exchange doesn't contain the bug that is needed for this exploit. Only Coinbase Wallet)*
